# Vault Event Notifications

## Needs more research

- Vault leader node is the only one that can publish events?
  - Docs say also supported by performance standby nodes, but was not able to confirm
- Impact of WebSockets at enterprise-scale?
- CloudEvent as webhooks, via centralized process that subscribes for everyone?
